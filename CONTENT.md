## FAQ SECTION

**Section Title:** Frequently Asked Questions

**Section Subtitle:** Everything you need to know about our services, process, and guarantees

### Category: Services & Coverage

**Q: What exactly do you cover? Is it just exams?**

We are your **complete academic concierge**. We handle everything you need to graduate:

- **Single Exams (OAs):** We take the stress out of high-stakes proctored exams.
- **Full Courses:** We handle both the assignments (PAs) and the final exam to clear a specific class.
- **Entire Degrees:** We can manage your whole Bachelor's or Master's program from day one to graduation.

Whether you are stuck on one math class or want to outsource your entire degree, we are the only solution you need.

---

**Q: Can you really finish my entire degree in 3 to 6 months?**

**Absolutely.** While a traditional timeline is 2–4 years, our "Coursework Ninja" accelerator, powered by our in-house subject-matter experts, is designed to clear hurdles quickly.

Because we handle the heavy lifting—research, writing, and exams—simultaneously, most of our students complete their Bachelor's or Master's programs in **under 6 months**, regardless of their full-time job or family commitments.

---

### Category: Process & Methods

**Q: How do you handle WGU Online Proctored Exams (OAs)?**

Imagine walking into your exam and having a "supercomputer" part of your brain activate—that's us.

- **The Setup:** You sit at your computer, looking calm and composed.
- **The Execution:** While you remain on camera, our expert team remotely connects to your system. We manage the mouse and keyboard seamlessly, selecting the correct answers in real-time.
- **The Experience:** You simply sit, watch, and succeed. It is stress-free, undetectable, and guarantees a high score.

---

**Q: How do you handle Performance Assessments (Papers/Tasks)?**

We don't just "write papers"; we draft **immaculate submissions** that guarantee you an exceptional score.

- **Subject Experts:** One of our 23 subject experts (not a generalist) will review your rubric.
- **Human Writing:** They write papers from scratch. Zero Plagiarism. Zero AI.
- **Revisions:** If an evaluator returns a task (which is rare), we handle the revisions immediately at no extra cost until it passes.

---

### Category: Guarantees & Trust

**Q: Do you 100% guarantee I will pass my WGU courses?**

**Yes.** We don't just "try," we deliver. We stand firmly by our results with a **100% Pass Guarantee**.

- **The Promise:** If, for any rare reason, you do not pass an assessment we handled, you will receive a full refund and a second attempt completely free of charge.
- **The Confidence:** We accept only courses for which our team of 23 subject experts has extensive experience. We know the rubrics, the proctors, and precisely what is required to pass. There is zero risk on your end.

---

**Q: How do I know your service is reliable? Can I pay after?**

We have built a solid reputation across student forums & social media channels by being transparent. We understand every student has different needs, so we offer tailored payment structures:

**1. For Individual Exams (OAs):**
- **Option A: Upfront Payment (Recommended):** Enjoy a seamless, fully private experience backed by our 100% Money-Back Guarantee.
- **Option B: Pay After Passing:** If you are sceptical, you can pay after you see the passing score.

*Note: As a safeguard for our time, this option requires a verified identity process, during which we record session details until payment is settled. Once paid, all records are permanently deleted within 10 minutes.*

**2. For Single Courses (Assignments + Exam):**
- **50% Upfront:** To start the coursework.
- **50% Before Final Exam:** Payable just before we take the final Objective Assessment (OA) or submit the final capstone.

We offer an interest-free instalment plan to make it affordable while we fast-track your graduation (typically 5–6 months):
- **Month 1:** 20% Deposit to begin.
- **Months 2–5:** 20% paid monthly.

---

### Category: Security & Privacy

**Q: Is my personal information and student account safe?**

Your privacy is our **absolute top priority**. We operate with "Ninja-like" stealth.

- **Clean Environment:** For your examinations and connecting to your devices, we utilize masked and proxy IPs, hardened virtual machines, and tools custom-built for security and stealth.
- **Data Minimisation:** We do not collect or store any personal information beyond what is strictly necessary. Once the job is done, the data is purged.
- **Zero AI Policy:** Unlike low-cost services that use ChatGPT (which WGU and university-prescribed AI detectors such as Turnitin detect easily), our work is 100% human-generated. This ensures you pass plagiarism checks and AI-detection scans every time.

---

### Category: Payment Methods

**Q: I don't have Crypto. How do I pay you?**

We primarily use cryptocurrency (USDT/USDC/BTC/ETH/SOL/XMR/DAI/LTC) to ensure **maximum financial privacy** for you. However, you do not need to be a crypto expert to pay us.

- **Using CashApp (USA):** You can buy and send Bitcoin instantly within the CashApp interface using your debit card. It takes less than 2 minutes.
- **Using Binance, Coinbase or MoonPay:** You can use your regular bank card to send the payment.

We provide a simple, step-by-step video guide on how to do this securely. It is as easy as sending a Venmo/PayPal.
